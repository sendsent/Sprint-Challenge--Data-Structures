**Q1** What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?
   - **Stack** - embodies the LIFO (Last In First Out) property
   - **Queue** - embodies the FIFO (First In First Out) propery

**Q2**: What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures?

   - **Linked List** O(n)
   - **Hash Table**  O(1)
   - **Binary Search Trees** Best case: O(1), worst case O(n)

**Q3**: What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?

From what I understand, a hash table at its lowest level is an array, but each entry in the array is a "bucket" of items - not just a single item. Let's say you have an object and you want to identify which bucket it belongs in, after you calculate the size, you'd compare the value of the object with each item in the bucket. Using the hash table lookup, you'll most likely have a search time of O(1), rather than O(n) for an unsorted array. 

## Challenge - spent an hour working on this and trying to figure it out, but not enough time spent on it to have something to submit here. I did find it interesting and was getting somewhere, so I may just return to this on my won time.
